# E-Commerce Business Analysis (SQL)

Welcome to the *"E-Commerce Business Analysis"* project!

In this project, I designed a relational database for an e-commerce store using PostgreSQL, and performed SQL analysis to uncover customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends. The focus is on generating practical business insights using real-world SQL queries.

---

## Tools Used

**PostgreSQL** – Relational database to store and query data  
**DBeaver** – SQL client used to interact with PostgreSQL  

> Note: This project was built and executed in DBeaver, connected to a PostgreSQL database.

## Database Structure

This project includes 5 main tables:

| Table         | Description                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `customers`   | Stores customer details: name, email, city, country, signup date         |
| `products`    | Stores product details: name, category, price                            |
| `orders`      | Records customer orders: customer ID, order date, status                 |
| `order_items` | Links orders to products with quantity and price                         |
| `payments`    | Tracks payments: order ID, payment method, amount, payment date          |

## Skills Demonstrated

* SQL Joins (INNER JOIN, multi-table joins)  
* Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)  
* Grouping & Filtering (GROUP BY, HAVING)  
* Date-based analysis (monthly trends)  
* Window functions (RANK, ranking by revenue)  
* Business insight generation and interpretation

## Analysis – Story Style

This project answers real business questions:

* Total Revenue – Total revenue generated by the store  
* Top Products – Best-selling products, helping identify customer favorites  
* Repeat Customers – Customers who made multiple purchases, highlighting loyalty  
* Monthly Revenue Trend – Month-over-month revenue analysis, showing growth or seasonal trends  
* Revenue by City – Revenue contribution by city, guiding regional strategies  
* Revenue by Category – Revenue by product category, informing stocking and marketing decisions  
* Category Performance Month by Month – Trends for each category over time  
* Customer Lifetime Value – Total spending per customer, highlighting high-value clients  
* Average Order Value (AOV) – Typical spending per order  
* Ranking Products – Products ranked by revenue, identifying top revenue drivers  

> Each analysis provides actionable insights for smarter business decisions and strategic planning.

## Key Insights

* The Electronics category generates the highest revenue  
* Repeat customers contribute significantly more revenue than one-time buyers  
* Revenue shows steady month-over-month growth, indicating a healthy business

## How to Run This Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
2. Open DBeaver and connect it to your **PostgreSQL** server.  
3. Create a new database (e.g., `ecommerce_project`).  
4. Run the provided SQL script to create tables and insert sample data.  
5. Execute the SELECT queries to explore analytics and generate insights.  
6. Modify or expand the dataset to experiment with more complex scenarios.
